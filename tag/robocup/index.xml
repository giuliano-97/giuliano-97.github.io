To that end, the players have to be detected, identified, and tracked reliably for the entire duration of the match. Player tracking in the &lt;a href="https://spl.robocup.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Standard Platorm League&lt;/a> is especially challenging since all the players look exactly the same, except for the color of their jersey, so state-of-the-art apperance-based approaches for pedestrian or vehicle tracking would fail. The proposed tracking framework uses non-linear optimization to fuse information from different sources - visual short-term tracking, self-localization from the players, game events, and jersey color detection - and is capable of reliably tracking players over 5 minute sequences with &amp;gt;90% accuracy.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
