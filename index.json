To that end, the players have to be detected, identified, and tracked reliably for the entire duration of the match. Player tracking in the Standard Platorm League is especially challenging since all the players look exactly the same, except for the color of their jersey, so state-of-the-art apperance-based approaches for pedestrian or vehicle tracking would fail. The proposed tracking framework uses non-linear optimization to fuse information from different sources - visual short-term tracking, self-localization from the players, game events, and jersey color detection - and is capable of reliably tracking players over 5 minute sequences with \u0026gt;90% accuracy.\n","date":1656633600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656633600,"objectID":"2442cfb24938c7d7ff7caa151cc6d39c","permalink":"https://giuliano-97.github.io/project/spl-player-tracking/","publishdate":"2022-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/spl-player-tracking/","section":"project","summary":"A framework for long-term player tracking in video recordings of soccer matches in the RoboCup Soccer Standard Platform League.","tags":["Deep Learning","Computer Vision","Multi-Object Tracking","Robotics","RoboCup"],"title":"Long-term Player Tracking in the RoboCup Soccer SPL","type":"project"}]
